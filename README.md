# ðŸš´ Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Case Study

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Welcome to the **Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study**!  
In this case study, I work as a junior data analyst for **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The companyâ€™s director of marketing, **Lily Moreno**, believes the future success of Cyclistic depends on **maximizing the number of annual memberships**.  

Currently, Cyclistic offers flexible pricing plans:  
- Single-ride passes  
- Full-day passes  
- Annual memberships  

Customers who purchase single-ride or day passes are considered **casual riders**, while those with annual memberships are **Cyclistic members**.  

Cyclisticâ€™s financial team has concluded that **annual members are far more profitable** than casual riders. Therefore, the marketing strategy will focus on **converting casual riders into annual members**.  

To do this, I will analyze Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to uncover insights into **how annual members and casual riders use the service differently**. These insights will guide data-driven marketing strategies.
